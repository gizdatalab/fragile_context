65 % of GIZ partner countries are classified as fragile and the number of respective projects is increasing. Fragile countries often lack security, basic infrastructure and economic opportunities due to destruction. Transitional aid in international cooperation aims to reestablish conditions for a peaceful economic and social reconstruction process.

COVID-19 has exacerbated existing and sometimes deeply rooted political, economic, social and security challenges, especially in fragile contexts.

Accordingly, the GIZ project Restoration of Peace, Livelihoods and Economic Cycles in Anbar, Iraq focuses on the rehabilitation of productive and social basic infrastructure in order to reactivate local economic cycles and the creation of income opportunities, and promotes peaceful and inclusive coexistence in Anbar for the most vulnerable people.
